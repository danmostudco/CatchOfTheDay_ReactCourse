# Built off of Wes Bos' React For Beginners course â€” [ReactForBeginners.com](https://ReactForBeginners.com)

I really love Wes' courses - he produces quality material and even went back to refactor his videos and repo after the React team made some extensive changes to accomdoate ECMA 6. When I saw he had made the udpated changes, I returned the course to give it a full pass through.

In this example project, I set up a theoretical fish market inventory system, which has a "back office" interface to manage current inventory, an order interface for building an order list for customers, and a front-facing fish menu which populated the order.

This was a repository for me to commit changes per each lesson and track changes so I could refer back to distinct changes down the road.

### Installation
Just fork the repo and within the root folder run
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### What's covered
I worked through this course and got the hang of a few key react concepts
  - laying out components, and creating nested components
  - using props to pass down state and functions from parent components
  - adding a router via a stateless component, using React Router 4
  - using modern js to import a file full of helper functions
  - toying with the app constructor to initialize state
  - loading sample data into the app's state
  - setting up syncing and authentication with firebase
  - using prop types to ensure data quality within each component

### End thoughts
As someone who works primarily on the design side of applications, I felt that React was a natural extension of the designer's mindset. Thinking about scalable, reusable components that can be dropped into multiple parts of the app is relevant for apps that span multiple contexts, viewport sizes, and devices, and this course proved to be a refreshing crash course in the nuts and bolts of such an approach.
